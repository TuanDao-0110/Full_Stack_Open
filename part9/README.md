1. with json file: 

The compiler option noImplicitAny makes it mandatory to have types for all variables used. 
2. type narrowing: 

[x]. TypeScript will only allow an operation (or attribute access) if it is valid for every member of the union.
[x]. The solution is to narrow the union with code... Narrowing occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.
